# AML_Reports_Code_EURECOM
I recently completed the [Algorithmic Machine Learning](https://www.eurecom.edu/en/course/aml-2025spring) (AML) course EURECOM given by Professor  [P.MICHIARDI's](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/michiardi-pietro), which focuses on developing robust methodologies for data science problems, particularly those involving machine learning. You can find my detailed report on this GitHub repository.

## Course Overview
The AML course is designed to ensure that students:

- Develop and apply sound methodologies for tackling data science challenges.
- Learn to create and validate their performance metrics.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world machine learning problems.
## Key Challenges
Unlike traditional machine learning competitions, such as those on Kaggle, the AML course emphasizes a more academic approach:

- No Automatic Scoring: Participants are required to define and test their performance metrics without relying on an automatic ranking system.
- Academic Submissions: Instead of focusing solely on performance scores, submissions are expected to be more academically rigorous, demonstrating a thorough understanding and application of data science methodologies.
